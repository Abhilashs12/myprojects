 My Smart Planner
This project is a React-based interactive event calendar built using CodeSandbox. It allows users to manage their schedule by creating, editing, deleting, searching, and rescheduling events through a monthly calendar view. Events are persisted in the browser using localStorage, ensuring they remain available even after refresh or page reload.
